<h1>Private financial web app</h1>
This was a demo version of a private financial app I made for a client in June 2019. 
It's supposed to show daily entries of the amount of money that was spent on different things.
I've used <strong>Firebase</strong> for BackEnd, even tho I don't really do BackEnd, but I managed to figure it out. For the FrontEnd I've used <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>MaterializeCSS</strong>. The app is in Serbian, but I changed it to English for this purpose. There are maybe a few lines of code with some Serbian words. 'cause the client wanted to be able to change a few things in the app if needed.</br>

<h2>How to use it:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Log in : E-mail: <strong>example@email.com </strong>, Password: <strong>admin123</strong></li>
<li>Plus is for adding a new entry</li>
<li>Arrow down is for sorting by date in descending order</li>
<li>Arrow up is for sorting in ascending order</li>
<li>The search symbol is for filtering through data by Name, Purpose, month or day and month. The filters can be combined expect the last two, they can't be used together at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Note:</h5> This is not the final version</br>
