<h1>Private financial web app</h1>
This was a demo version of a private financial app I made for a client in June 2019. 
It's supposed to show daily entries of the amount of money that was spent on different things.
I've used <strong>Firebase</strong> for BackEnd, even tho I don't really do BackEnd, but I managed to figure it out. For the FrontEnd I've used <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>MaterializeCSS</strong>. The app is in Serbian, but I changed it to English for this purpose. There are maybe a few lines of code with some Serbian words. 'cause the client wanted to be able to change a few things in the app if needed.</br>

I removed the instructions how to log in, 'cause someone was messing with it. But if you wan't to check it out, contact me.

<h5>Note:</h5> This is not the final version</br>
